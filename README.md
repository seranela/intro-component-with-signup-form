## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I can add CSS styles for users who are not using JavaScript by using the built-in pseudo selectors in an independent stylesheet that is loaded with `<noscript>`. Otherwise, I can use JavaScript to add custom styles.

In Firefox, there's a way to test for cases when JavaScript is disabled without having to download an extension. Press F12 to open the Dev Tools, select the Debugger tab and then click the Settings (gear) icon. In the settings drop-down, select Disable JavaScript.
